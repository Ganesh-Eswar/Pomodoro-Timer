Pomodoro Timer app:
🍅 There are 4 Pomodoros: Each Pomodoro represents a focused work session, typically set to 25 minutes.
🧘‍♀ After each Pomodoro, we have 3 Short Breaks: These breaks provide a quick moment to relax and recharge, lasting around 15 minutes each.
🌼 To keep things balanced, after completing the third Short Break, we have a Long Break of 30 minutes. It's an opportunity to unwind, stretch, or grab a healthy snack.
⏰ Once the Long Break ends, we jump right back into the next Pomodoro, continuing the cycle of productivity.

🔁 Pomodoro -> Short Break -> Pomodoro -> Short Break -> Pomodoro -> Short Break -> Pomodoro -> Long Break -> Pomodoro Complete

But that's not all! I've added a new feature to the Pomodoro Timer app, making it even more versatile and adaptable to our needs:
✨ Flexibility at Your Fingertips ✨
Now, we can customize the duration of each Pomodoro, Short Break, and Long Break according to our preference. Whether you need more focused work time or longer breaks for rejuvenation, this tool allows you to tailor the timings to suit your workflow. 🕒🔧
